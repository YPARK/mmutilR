# Matrix Market Utility for R

This `R` package contains a list of functions that can be useful in processing single-cell RNA-seq data generated by 10x Genomics with simplicity and memory-efficiency. 

### Design philosophy (that you may not like)

* Do not attempt to populate everything in memory

* Avoid using `R` class objects (or a list of lists)

* Column (cell) indexing to achieve scalable random access

* Hopefully, one function does one thing

## Installation

`R CMD INSTALL mmutilR_${version}.tar.gz`

## Data editing

## Random access

## Marker-based cell type annotation

## Matching between columns

## Simulation
